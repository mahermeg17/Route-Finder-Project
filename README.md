# Route-Finder-Project

**Route Finder Project** is a mapping application created in Java for providing and visualizing map routes, similar to Google Maps. 
This project was created as part of UCSD's Coursera class "Advanced Data Structures in Java", course 3 of their "Java Programming:
Object Oriented Design of Data Structures Specialization" cirriculum. The code and files in this repository include my implementations
for their class' project.
